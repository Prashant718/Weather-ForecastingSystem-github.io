		<dd>Weather simply refers to the condition of air on the earth at a given place and time. It
			is a continuous, data-intensive, multidimensional, dynamic and chaotic process. These
			properties make weather forecasting is a formidable challenge. Forecasting is the process
			of estimation in unknown situations from the historical data<br><br>	
		</dd>
		<dt style="background-color:pink;">TRADITIONAL WEATHER FORECASTING
			<dd>
			<br>Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the
			state of the atmosphere for a given location. Weather forecasts are made by collecting
			quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific
			understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve. There
			are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts
			because they are used to protect life and property. 
			</dd>
			<dd>
			<br>In ancient times, forecasting was mostly based on weather pattern observation.
			Over the years, the study of weather patterns has resulted in various techniques for
			rainfall forecasting. Present rainfall forecasting embodies a combination of computer
			models, interpretation, and an acquaintance of weather patterns. The following technique
			was used for existing weather prediction. 
			
			<ul>
			<li class="ul">Use of a barometer</li>
			<li class="ul">Looking at the sky</li>
			<li class="ul">Nowcasting</li>
			<li class="ul">Analog technique</li>
			<li class="ul">Numerical Weather Prediction model</li>
			<li class="ul">Ensemble Forecasting</li>
			<li class="ul">Radar</li>
			<li class="ul">Weather satellites</li>
			<li class="ul">Weather maps</li>
			</ul>

		<dt style="background-color:pink;">TYPES OF WEATHER FORECASTING
		<dd>
		<ul>
		
		<li class="ul"><mark>Persistence Forecasting</mark></li>
		<dd>The simplest method of forecasting the weather is persistence forecasting. It relies
		upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This can be a valid way of
			forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state, such as during the summer season in
			the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant
			weather pattern. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.
			This assumes that what the weather is doing now is what it will continue to do. To find
			out what the weather is doing, meteorologists make weather observations.
		</dd>
		<li class="ul"><mark>Synoptic Forecasting</mark></li>
		<dd>
		This method uses the basic rules for forecasting. Meteorologists take their
		observations, and apply those rules to make a short-term forecast
		</dd>
		<li class="ul"><mark>Statistical Forecasting</mark></li>
		<dd>
		Meteorologists ask themselves, what does it usually do this time of the
		year? Records of average temperatures, average rainfall and average snowfall over the
		years give forecasters an idea of what the weather is "supposed to be like" at a certain
		time of the year.
		</dd>
		<li class="ul"><mark>Computer forecasting</mark></li>
		<dd>
		Forecasters take their observations and plug the numbers into complicated
		equations. Several ultra-high-speed computers run these various equations to make
		computer "models" which give a forecast for the next several days. Often, different
		equations produce different results, so meteorologists must always use the other
		forecasting methods along with this one. 
		</dd>
		</ul>
		</dd>
		</dt>		
		<dt style="background-color:pink;"> IMPORTANCE OF WEATHER FORECASTING
		<dd>
		<br>Weather forecasting is used in many situations like severe weather alerts and
		advisories, predicting the behavior of the cloud for air transport, prediction of waterways
		in a sea, agricultural development and avoiding forest fire.
		</dd>
		<dd>
		<br><b>Severe weather alerts and advisories :</b>
			<dd>
			A major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and
			advisories which are the national weather serviceâ€™s issue in anticipation of severe or
			hazardous weather are expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some of the
			most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and
			tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of
			these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog.
			Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio,
			using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System which breaks into regular
			programming [LEB08]. 
			</dd>
		</dd>
		
		<dd>
		<br><b>Predicting the behavior of the cloud for Air transport :</b>
			<dd>
			The aviation industry is especially sensitive to the weather and accurate weather
			forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from
			landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards.
			Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircrafts because of severe turbulence due to their
			updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large
			hail, strong winds, and lightning, all of which can cause severe damage to an aircraft in
			flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine
			power within ash clouds [JRD06]. 
			</dd>
		</dd>
		
		<dd>
		<br><b>Prediction of waterways in a sea :</b>
			<dd>
			Commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by
			wind direction, speed, wave periodicity, high tides and precipitation. These factors can
			each influence the safety of marine transit. Consequently, a variety of codes have been
			established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via
			radio, for example marine forecast. Typical weather forecasts can be received at sea
			through the use of Radio fax.
			</dd>
		</dd>
		
		<dd>
		<br><b>Agricultural development :</b>
			<dd>
			Weather plays an important role in agricultural production. It has a profound
			influence on the growth, development and yields of a crop, incidence of pests and
			diseases, water needs and fertilizer requirements in terms of differences in nutrient
			mobilization due to water stresses and timeliness and effectiveness of prophylactic and
			cultural operations on crops. <br>Weather aberrations may cause physical damage to crops and soil erosion. The quality of the crop produced during movement from field to
			storage and transport to market depends on weather. Bad weather may affect the quality
			of the produce during transport and viability and vigor of seeds and planting material
			during storage.</li>
			</ul>
			</dd>
		</dd>
		
		<dd>
		<br><b>Avoiding Forest fire  :</b>
			<dd>
			Weather forecasting of wind, precipitations and humidity is essential for
			preventing and controlling wildfires. Different indices, like the Forest fire weather index
			and the Haines Index, have been developed to predict the areas more at risk to experience
			fire from natural or human causes. Conditions for the development of harmful insects can
			also be predicted by weather forecasting.
			</ul>
			</dd>
		</dd>
		
		<dd>
		<br><b>Military applications :</b>
			<dd>
			Military weather forecasters present weather conditions to the war fighter
			community. Military weather forecasters provide pre-flight and in-flight weather briefs to
			pilots and provide real time resource protection services for military installations. Naval
			forecasters cover the waters and ship weather forecasts. The Navy provides a special
			service to both themselves and the rest of the federal government by issuing forecasts for
			tropical cyclone across the Pacific and Indian Oceans through their Joint Typhoon
			Warning Center. 
			</ul>
			</dd>
		</dd>
		
		<dd>
		<br><b>Air Force :</b>
			<dd>
			Air Force Weather provides weather forecasting for the Air Force and the Army.
			Air Force forecasters cover air operations in both wartime and peacetime operations and
			provide Army support. Military and civilian forecasters actively cooperate in analyzing
			and creating weather forecast products.<br><br>
